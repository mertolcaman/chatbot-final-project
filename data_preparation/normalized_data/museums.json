        "description": "the alsancak tekel factory, whose history dates back to the end of the 19th century, after restoration, renovation and reconstruction works in accordance with its original form, has transformed into a cultural and artistic center of the new generation that will shape the cultural and artistic life of izmir. the unused buildings of the factory, which is one of the most important industrial heritages of the city with its 140-year history, were re-functionalized and brought into the future. the historic factory opened its doors to culture and art, this time under the name “izmir culture and arts factory”. with its museums remodeled according to the concept of modern museology, libraries that appeal to all segments of the population – from children and young people to adult readers and researchers of all ages, cultural and art workshops, and a vast landscape and recreational area suitable for outdoor activities, the izmir culture and arts factory is a candidate for the new center of attraction for the city and will continue to be a source for those who are building the world of the future while helping to preserve the city’s historical memory. izmir culture and arts factory is one of the windows to the cultural and art world of our country and izmir and an original and innovative cultural and art center that responds to the artistic, cultural, educational and social needs of society with its services, a place where the people of the city interact with culture, art and nature. it stands out as a pleasant meeting place for all citizens and visitors of the city. departure of western anatolia, industrial activities emerged in the period from the 16th to the mid-19th century, generally due to the export of agricultural products. with the rapid increase in the volume of trade in the second half of the 19th century, there were significant developments in the industrial life of izmir. many large industrial plants are opened, such as a spinning mill, a coal-gas factory, a water factory and a cigarette factory. as a result of the trade agreements that the ottoman empire concluded with england and france, foreign merchants subordinated to these two countries settled in izmir from 1838. in 1881, the duyûn-u umûmiye (public debts) administration was established to pay the foreign debts of the empire, and all taxes collected from stamps, alcoholic beverages and tobacco were reserved for domestic and foreign debts. the régie de tabacs (tobacco regiment), created in 1884 as an enterprise of the administration, took over the tobacco monopoly and began designing three factories that same year, following the policy of establishing large factories. one of those three projects was the alsancak cigarette factory. only two years after the establishment of the turkish republic, in 1925, the tobacco regiment was purchased from the french by the state, and all the rights and obligations of the regiment were accordingly transferred to the state. the “tobacco monopoly law (tutun inhisari kanunu)” enacted in 1930 marked the first steps of tekel, which had been the sole manufacturer and distributor of alcohol and tobacco products in turkiye for many years. alsancak cigarette factory, which was actively used in the early years of the republic and whose production chart increased in the 1940s, continued its production activities as a tekel enterprise until 2004. the buildings on the factory premises are registered via various decisions of the protection authority in 1979, 1985 and 2007. the largest building, which is the identity of izmir culture and arts factory and served as the production center in the center of the historical alsancak tekel factory, was transformed into museum icaf – the archaeology and ethnography museum after careful restoration and renovation works carried out in accordance with the original. archaeological artifacts are displayed on the ground and first floors of the 7,240-square-meter, two-story building, and ethnographic artifacts on the second floor. the museum, which displays gold, metal, marble, terracotta, stone and glass works from the region, as well as historical textiles and unique manuscripts, invites visitors of all ages to take a pleasant historical and cultural journey through the past centuries, with thematic exhibitions reflecting the museology understanding of the new generation. the izmir painting and sculpture museum, opened on september 9, 1952 by bruno taut as the first gallery in the building of the ministry of education in today’s kultur park, hosted its visitors in its building in konak from 1973 to 2022. the museum, which was relocated to kultur park after the october 30, 2020 earthquake that shook the region, began operating on march 25, 2022, and opened its doors to art-loving visitors at the izmir culture and arts factory in april 2023. the izmir painting and sculpture museum, which receives its visitors in

        "description": "pergamum is a district that located in western anatolia, at north of izmir. this important cultural center with its rich history hosts archaeological ruins and artifacts that have been protected until today. bergama, anciently pergamum is established on a hill. archaeological data achieved from this hill (pergamum acropolis) indicates that history of this city goes back to vii – vi centuries b.c. however, researches performed on kaikos valley where ancient city is located, indicates that this region was inhabited since earlier (prehistoric) ages. pergamum name means a citadel and the suffix “amon” indicates that it comes from luwi language or western anatolian languages. the first information about pergamum was given in the book of anabasis which means “return of thousands” was written in 399 bc. but continuous information about historic process of city begins with the conquest of anatolia by alexander in 334 bce. including that of pergamum in mysia passed to the administration of king of thrace, lysimachus who was one of the generals of alexander. lysimachus appointed philetarus as an officer who was responsible from the state treasury to protect 9.000 talent (approximately 2.7 million solid gold) here. philetarus who stored that money in the acropolis later found the city of pergamum with that treasure upon the death of his boss, lysimachus in 282 bc. kingdom of pergamum by dominating the political, economic, social, cultural and scientific fields during the hellenistic period for 150 years with playing an important role lived his golden age. the period of kingdom starting with philetarus (281-263 bc) as attalids continued by his successors (i.eumenes (263-241 bc), i.attalus (241-197 bc), ii.eumenes (bc 197-159), ii.attalus (159-138 bc) and iii.attalus (138-133 bc). upon death of last king of pergamum attalus iii, pergamum passed to roman empire through inheritance and still survives as an important state of asia minor. roman era was a bright period again for pergamum. increasing population, the architecture comprehension expanding into plain of bakircay, the social structures that served the entertainment industry, with new solutions in architecture as a province of the roman world remained important. separation of roman empire (ad 395) caused beginning of byzantine age for pergamum. during this period, the tradition of religious architecture function manifested in the development and spread of christianity becomes one of the important centers of anatolia. the ancient city of pergamum during roman period covers a large area beginning from the acropolis to the west of the bakircay plain. expanding within the city limits of the roman temple (basilica) and the amphitheater of the sanctuary of asklepeion, theatres and stadiums. however, these theatres and stadiums are still earthed and unexcavated today. the sanctuary of asklepeion, in the same years of the city established, located outside the borders of city as a treatment center. the city's historical process of the arab invasions in the year 716, in the year 1345 under the sovereignty of the turkish period continues with menteseogullari reaches up to the present. during turkish age, city was expanded from outskirts of acropolis towards plain parts of bakircay valley. mosques, masjids, shops, bazaar, bridges, inns and baths, fountains, streets and residential architecture with the concept of the turkish culture and turkish concept are many works that reflect the architectural tradition. basilica planned scheme of ulu mosque (1398-1399), seljuk minaret (14th-15th centuries) 's glazed and unglazed brick ornaments, tabaklar bath (14th-15th centuries)'s dome switch used with embellishments on the wall surfaces stenciled decorations of art history are very important.. also, republic period structures that are dated 20th century represent a different face of the city architecture with their neo classic styles. old pergamum high school, old headquarters building and old executive office building are the a few good samples to the remarkable structures from those days. acropolis in the pergamum acropolis settlement planning land was shaped according to the geographical structure. from the top of the hill, with terracing method extended to the south and west. the palaces, great temples, social and cultural structures built with the laid grid system showing development in urban architecture at two sections as upper and lower city in two sections exposes an successful urban planning example. in the public area that is named as upper city and being the residence place of kings, the royal palaces, arsenals and large temples were constructed. in the lower city, temple of demeter, hera temple, gymnasium and lower agora in a leaner approach to public order in the evolving architecture is remarkable. in the upper city, the temple of trajan for roman emperors hadrian and trajan (2nd century a.d.), the big problem of placement and handling in steep terrain were carried out with great skill with supporting vaults from beneath. the lower terrace of the temple south placed immediately famous pergamum library with its rich collection of 200. 000-volumes of scrolls from the hellenistic period. in the library which connected with the temple of athena in architecture technique; much richer collection of works was created with discovery of the scrolls by pergamum as a new writing tool. athena temple (4th century b.c.) is the earliest temple of pergamum and devoted to protector of the city athena. with the availability of orientation separated from other temples, monumental entrance and votive statues in the temenos area in the parapet of the gallery with the spoils of war weapons reliefs of the galatians is extremely remarkable. on the west side of acropolis; pergamum theatre is located which was constructed in the hellenistic age with 10.000 people capacity but unstable wooden stage building. in the north of the theatre, another temple is located dedicated to the god of wine dionysus has the cohesion with theatre architecture and as the meaning of theatre being. in the south west of the theatre, at lower code, the most famous work of school at pergamum sculpture, pergamum altar of zeus was built after an ultimate successful result and certain victory of attalus i against galatians the barbarians, and also dedicated goddess athena and god zeus. in the reliefs on the friezes, the war, pergamenes were depicted as the gods from olympus but the enemies, galatians as giants in a indirect narrative expression. a sentimental (pathetic) expression of the reliefs was an important contribution to antique styled sculptures of pergamum.",
