Name: Gevrek
Description: Another delightful treat from İzmir is gevrek, often confused with simit in Türkiye but has a slightly different flavor. The main difference between gevrek and simit lies in the preparation process. While simit is dipped in molasses and covered with sesame seeds before baking, gevrek is first dipped into a pot of hot molasses and briefly fried, then sesame-coated and baked. This process makes gevrek crunchier compared to simit. İzmir Gevrek was granted a geographical indication in 2021.
